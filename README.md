# Dev Challennges Projects

Welcome to my Dev Challenges repository! Here you'll find a collection of projects I've completed from **Dev Challenges**, a great platform designed to improve web development skills through **real-world** projects.

## About Dev Challenges 🎨
Frontend Mentor is a platform that provides a variety of front-end coding challenges to help developers improve their skills. Each challenge includes a figma design file and screenshots to implement the design using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript ( obviously any framework usage is fine, the site doesn't restrict anything.)**

## NOTE ❗
> Some of the projects require having pro membership to get the Figma files, hence why some of my projects are not pixel-perfect.

> Project difficulties: **Beginner, Junior, Mid-level, Upper-mid, Senior**
